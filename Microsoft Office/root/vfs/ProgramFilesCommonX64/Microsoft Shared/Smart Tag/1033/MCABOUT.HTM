        <b>Measurement Converter</b> Measurement Converter recognizes commonly used metric and imperial
        measurement units in a Word document. You can then convert units from one system
        to the other, for example convert miles to kilometers or pints to liters. You can
        also add new recognized units and edit conversion rules. Measurement Converter works with Word
        2010 and in Outlook 2010 when you use Word as your e-mail editor.</p>
    <p>
        <b>Syntax of measurement units</b> Measurement Converter recognizes measurement units with
        the following syntax: <i>&lt;float value&gt;&lt;space (optional)&gt;&lt;unit name&gt;</i>,
        for example “1,234.678 km.” Measurement Converter recognizes numbers consisting of 12 digits
        or fewer, including decimal places.</p>
    <p>
        <b>Supported conversions</b> Most conversions are simple multiplications by a coefficient.
        By default, Measurement Converter supports the following conversions:

        <b>Conversion precision</b> Measurement Converter rounds results of all
        conversions. Rounding precision differs between conversion rules. Rounding precision
        is defined for each conversion rule as the number of decimal places in the conversion
        result. The precision is set to two decimal places for most conversions, and it is
        adjusted accordingly for conversions where the target value is much larger or much
        smaller than the source value.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Use Excel for more conversions</b> You can use Microsoft Excel for more conversion
        features. The CONVERT() formula supports a wide range of measurement conversions
        in an Excel worksheet. See Excel online help for information on how to enable the CONVERT()
        formula.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Editing the list of conversions</b> You can add, remove, or modify measurement
        units that are recognized in Word documents. Measurement Converter reads 
        conversion rules from a Unicode text file (metconv.txt) when Word is launched.
        You can open metconv.txt in Notepad and edit the contents. Each line in the metconv.txt
        represents a conversion rule. Each rule is defined by 10 fields, delimited by commas:

    <p>
        Measurement Converter always supports conversion rules that have “All”
        in Field #1. In addition to these rules, Measurement Converter also supports rules with an
        LCID value that matches the user locale of your Windows Language and Regional Options.
        For example, if the user locale on your system is set to Russian, Measurement Converter
        will load conversion rules marked “All” and “1049” in Field #1.
    </p>
    <p>
        Field #2 (“Source unit name”) contains the recognizable strings; that is,
        strings that Measurement Converter will detect and tag in a Word document. You can add comments
        in the metconv.txt on a new line as long as they are preceded by the “//” delimiter.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Note:</b> New rules can be added anywhere in the metconv.txt file.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Number formats</b> Measurements in international documents may use various decimal
        separators and grouping symbols. Measurement Converter recognizes numbers
        that use dot or comma as the decimal separator and numbers that use dot, comma, or space as the grouping
        symbol. If the correct format cannot be determined from the measurement value alone,
        Measurement Converter will check the current user locale in Regional and Language Options,
        and it will assume that the measurement uses the format defined there. For example, if the
        measurement is “2,234 km” and the user locale is French, the value is interpreted
        as “two point two hundred thirty-four kilometers.” If the same measurement is recognized
        on a system with user locale set to English, it is interpreted as “two thousand
        two hundred thirty-four kilometers.” Measurement Converter only recognizes numbers where digits
        are grouped in groups of three.
